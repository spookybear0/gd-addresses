# gd-addresses
Pointers, addresses and offsets for geometry dash 2.1!

These will NOT currently work for the latest version of GD (2.2). This will be updated to support it when addresses are found.

These are all windows-compatible. For mac offsets, go to [this page](https://github.com/camden314/GDMacSymbols)

Pull requests are welcome!
If you are contributing addresses, you must make the changes to the pages branch and the master branch.
